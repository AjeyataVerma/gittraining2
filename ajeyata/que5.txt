Q.Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

When there is a git push you want to perform and the remote repo rejects it, there is a dangerous way to make it work:
git push --force

This dangerous method is so popular most IDEs have a special checkbox for it.
On the other hand, the IDEs usually have no checkbox for force-with-lease, itâ€™s not usually mentioned in the documents

git push --force-with-lease

When to Use Force with Lease
Assuming a regular push does not work, one does not need to use force if they are doing decent day-to-day work. 
Every day-to-day need is satisfied with force-with-lease. These include any sort of a rebase, particularly:
Rebase a branch onto another branch,
Rewording a commit in the past,
Squashing a few commits together,
Reordering the commits, or
Changing the author of a previous commit.


When to Use Force
When doing something nasty. This includes:
Removing a commit together with its contributions from history,
Removing a large file that was accidentally committed from history,
Removing a folder from the repo together with all its history.
